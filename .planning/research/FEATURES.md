## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features users assume exist in any menu translation/scanning product. Missing these makes NOM feel incomplete compared to MenuGuide, FoodieLens, or Yelp Menu Vision.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Camera/photo scan → menu parsing | Core product promise. Any competitor offers this. Missing = broken | HIGH | OCR pipeline: image → text extraction → dish segmentation. Must handle dark lighting, blurry, angled, handwritten menus. Veryfi and GPT-4o Vision both viable. GPT-4o is simpler to integrate but higher per-call cost |
| QR code scan → URL → menu parsing | In 2025, most Strasbourg restaurants have QR codes linking to PDFs or menu pages. Users expect one tap | MEDIUM | Two sub-cases: (1) QR → PDF → OCR pipeline, (2) QR → HTML menu page → structured parsing. Both must be handled. jsQR or native camera API for QR detection |
| URL/link menu parsing | Users find menus on Google before arriving. Paste a link, get dish cards | MEDIUM | Fetch page HTML, extract structured data (schema.org/Restaurant markup if available), fallback to AI extraction. Apify-style scraping or direct GPT-4o with HTML context. Handle: PDFs, dynamic JS-rendered menus, third-party platforms (TheFork, TripAdvisor menu tabs) |
| Dish cards (image + name + translated description) | Visual format is the universal standard for food in 2026. Text-only menus feel like 2010 | MEDIUM | Each card: dish photo (real or AI-generated), translated name, 2-3 sentence description, dietary icons. FoodieLens confirmed this is the standard format. Swipe or grid layout both work |
| Translation FR/EN + TR/DE/ES/IT | Strasbourg test market explicitly spans Turkish, German, French, Italian restaurants. Users from any of these backgrounds need their language | MEDIUM | GPT-4o handles all 6 languages with strong culinary context. Do not use Google Translate — lacks food-specific terminology. "Doner" should stay "Doner", not become "Donor" |
| Dietary/allergen flags on dish cards | EU regulation awareness drives user expectation. Post-2024 French food law tightened allergen disclosure | MEDIUM | Minimum 14 EU allergens (gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk, tree nuts, celery, mustard, sesame, sulphites, lupin, molluscs). Vegetarian/vegan markers. Spicy indicator. Budget flag (price relative to menu average) |
| Allergen disclaimer (never "guaranteed") | Legal and safety standard. Every verified allergen app uses this. Omitting creates liability | LOW | Standard wording: "Allergen info is inferred from dish descriptions. Ingredients may vary. Always inform your server of allergies before ordering." Must appear on every dish card with allergen flags. Non-negotiable |
| Scan result caching (per restaurant) | Restaurant Wi-Fi is unreliable. Users expect scanned menu to persist during the meal | MEDIUM | Cache in localStorage + Supabase. TTL: 24h for user session, 7 days in shared DB. Each scan contributes to shared menu cache for future users |
| Trust badges (Verified vs Inferred) | Users need to know when data is confirmed vs AI-guessed. Competitors do not do this — NOM must, per product rules | LOW | Two states: "✅ Menu Verified" (data comes from official restaurant source) vs "⚠ AI Inferred" (extracted/generated by AI). Show on dish card and on scan result header |
| No account required to scan | Expectation from the product rules. Friction-free first scan is table stakes in 2026 | LOW | Anonymous scanning with session-based credit tracking. Device fingerprint or session cookie for free tier limits. Account creation unlocks history |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features NOM's competitors (MenuGuide, FoodieLens, AnyMenu) do not offer. These are where NOM competes.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| AI Top 3 assistant ("Ask NOM") | No competitor recommends from scanned menu. They all translate — none suggest. "What should I order?" answered in one tap | HIGH | GPT-4o with context: full parsed menu + user dietary filters + request criteria (diversity, clarity, match). Returns exactly 3 dishes with rationale. 3x/day free, then paywall. The paywall hits after value is demonstrated — correct timing |
| Reverse search ("I want X") | "I want something vegetarian and not too heavy" → highlighted dishes from scanned menu. Natural language input → dish filter. No competitor does this | HIGH | Client-side: filter scanned dish list by tags/properties. Server-side for nuanced queries: send query + dish list to GPT-4o, get ranked subset back. Simpler than building embeddings — start with GPT-4o ranking |
| Multilingual allergen phrases | Per product rule: allergen warnings appear in the user's language, always with "ask server" phrasing | MEDIUM | Pre-translated disclaimer phrases for all 6 supported languages. Never AI-generated on the fly for safety text — use fixed, reviewed translations. Store as locale strings |
| Menu caching as DB enrichment | Each user scan feeds shared restaurant menu database. Second user scanning same restaurant gets instant results | MEDIUM | On scan: check Supabase `menus` table by restaurant_id or URL hash. If fresh (<7 days): return cached, skip AI call. If stale/missing: run pipeline, store result. Network effect compounds value |
| Photo OCR fallback (camera) | For handwritten menus, chalk boards, paper menus with no QR code. Handles the real-world Strasbourg restaurant that hasn't digitised | HIGH | Harder than PDF OCR. GPT-4o Vision is the current best approach for arbitrary menu photos. Pre-process: straighten, enhance contrast before sending. Set user expectation: "Handwritten menus may have lower accuracy" |
| Dietary filter UX on dish cards | Most apps show allergen text. NOM filters the card grid in real time — tap "vegetarian" and irrelevant cards grey out or hide | LOW | Client-side filter on dish tag array. Tags set during AI parsing. Instant, no server round-trip |
| Top 3 criteria transparency | Show WHY each dish was picked: "Diverse — not all meat", "Clear description — no guessing", "Matches your no-gluten filter". Builds trust in the AI | MEDIUM | Include brief rationale string in Top 3 API response. Render as subtitle under each recommended dish card |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

| Anti-Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Guaranteed allergen accuracy | Users with severe allergies want certainty | NOM parses menus written by restaurants that are often incomplete. Guaranteeing accuracy creates liability and false safety. Fatal if wrong | Always show "⚠ AI Inferred" badge and "ask server" disclaimer. Never remove this warning, even when confidence is high |
| Full menu translation for all 100+ languages | "Be global from day 1" | The Strasbourg market is FR/EN/TR/DE/ES/IT. Supporting 100 languages spreads QA surface area, increases prompt complexity, and adds untestable edge cases at launch | Ship 6 languages, validate quality. Add languages based on user demand signals post-launch |
| Nutrition tracking (calories, macros) | Health-conscious users request it | Requires per-dish nutritional database that restaurants don't maintain. AI-estimated calories are unreliable and create health risk if acted on. Yazio/MyFitnessPal own this space | Allergen flags cover the safety use case. Explicitly out of scope in product rules |
| User-editable dish descriptions | "Let users correct AI errors" | Opens moderation burden. Bad actors can poison menu data. Trust badge system collapses if community edits are mixed with AI-inferred data | Implement a "flag as incorrect" button instead. Human review before any edit goes live |
| Real-time menu scraping on every page load | "Always up-to-date menus" | Restaurant websites block scrapers, rate-limit, and change structure constantly. This approach will break silently and frequently | Cache menus with TTL. Show "last updated" timestamp. Manual refresh button for users who want fresh data |
| AI-generated dish photos for all dishes | "Every dish should have a visual" | AI food photos are visually appealing but misleading — the actual dish will look different. Creates disappointment and trust issues at the table | Use real photos from web search when available (Yelp, Google Images via API). Show AI-generated as last resort with "Illustrative image" label |
| "Feed" of recent restaurant scans | "Social proof, show what others are scanning" | Violates the product rule: scan = home, never feed. A social feed changes the app's information architecture and creates a maintenance burden | Trust badges and cache-hit counts ("47 people scanned this menu") are sufficient social proof without a feed |
| Infinite AI Top 3 calls for free | "Remove friction for best experience" | GPT-4o calls cost ~$0.01-0.03 per Top 3 request. At scale this is unsustainable. The paywall is the business model | 3 free/day is the proven freemium threshold (MenuGuide uses 3 scans/day free). Hitting the limit after value is demonstrated converts well |

### Dependency Notes

- **Translation must happen before dish card generation:** Cards cannot render without translated names and descriptions. The AI parsing + translation step is the critical path — everything downstream depends on it.
- **Allergen detection is a parallel step to translation, not sequential:** The same GPT-4o call can handle both. Request: "translate this dish list to [language] AND tag each with EU allergens present." This halves the API calls.
- **Menu cache lookup must happen BEFORE the AI pipeline:** Cache hit = instant result, no API cost. Only call AI if cache is cold or stale. This is the cost-control mechanism.
- **AI Top 3 requires dietary filters to be set first:** Without filters, Top 3 defaults to generic "popular/interesting" mode. With filters, it becomes personalised. Filters should be captured at session start (no account needed — store in sessionStorage).
- **Reverse search has two modes:** (1) Client-side tag filter (fast, free, covers simple cases: "vegetarian", "no nuts"). (2) GPT-4o ranked query (handles nuanced: "something light but filling"). Start with client-side only for v1.
- **Trust badges depend on data source, not AI confidence:** "Verified" = data came from official restaurant menu page or PDF. "Inferred" = AI extracted from ambiguous source. This is a source metadata flag, not an accuracy score.
- **Allergen disclaimer text must be static locale strings:** Never generate safety disclaimers with AI. Pre-translate all 6 languages, store as constants, render from locale file.

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1)

Core scan-to-cards loop. Everything else is additive.

- [ ] QR code scan → URL detection → menu extraction — the fastest path to dish cards
- [ ] URL/link paste → menu parsing — for users who find menus on Google first
- [ ] Photo OCR (camera fallback) — essential for Strasbourg restaurants with paper/chalk menus
- [ ] Translation in 6 languages (FR, EN, TR, DE, ES, IT) — covers Strasbourg test market
- [ ] Dish cards with image, translated name, 2-sentence description, price
- [ ] EU allergen tags on each dish card (14 mandatory allergens + vegan/vegetarian/spicy)
- [ ] Allergen disclaimer in user's language (static locale strings, never AI-generated)
- [ ] Trust badge per dish card (✅ Verified / ⚠ Inferred)
- [ ] Dietary filter UI (tap to filter cards: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, no nuts)
- [ ] AI Top 3 assistant — 3x/day free, paywall after — this is the "wow moment"
- [ ] Menu caching in Supabase — cache each scan result, serve to next user scanning same restaurant
- [ ] Session-based credit counter (no account required, device fingerprint)

### Add After Validation (v1.x)

Add when core loop is stable and first 50 real scans have been done.

- [ ] Reverse search ("I want X") — client-side filter first, GPT-4o ranking second
- [ ] Top 3 rationale display ("Why: high diversity + matches your no-gluten filter")
- [ ] Real dish photo lookup via Yelp Fusion API or Google Places Photos
- [ ] Budget filter (flag dishes relative to menu price average)
- [ ] "Last scanned" timestamp + manual refresh button on cached menus

### Future Consideration (v2+)

Defer until product-market fit confirmed in Strasbourg.

- [ ] Expanded language support beyond 6 (add based on user location data)
- [ ] Account-linked scan history (requires auth flow)
- [ ] B2B restaurant QR codes (NOM-optimised QR codes for restaurant tables)
- [ ] Advanced personalisation (Taste Profile feeding Top 3)
- [ ] Nutrition estimates (only if demand is clear and liability framework established)

## Competitor Feature Analysis

| Feature | MenuGuide | FoodieLens | Yelp Menu Vision | NOM (planned) |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| QR scan | No (photo only) | No (photo only) | Yes (camera overlay) | Yes — camera + QR detection |
| URL paste | No | No | No | Yes — unique input vector |
| Photo OCR | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Translation languages | 100+ | 100+ | English output only | 6 (FR/EN/TR/DE/ES/IT) — quality over quantity |
| Dish cards | Yes (image + text) | Yes (image + text) | Overlay on camera | Yes — structured card UI |
| Allergen detection | Yes (basic) | No | No | Yes — EU 14-allergen standard |
| Allergen disclaimer | Basic text | None | None | Yes — multilingual locale strings |
| Trust badges | No | No | No | Yes — core product rule |
| Dietary filter UI | Profile-based | No | No | Yes — real-time card filter |
| AI recommendation (Top 3) | No | No | No | Yes — primary differentiator |
| Reverse search | No | No | No | Yes |
| Menu caching / DB enrichment | No | No | No | Yes — compounding network effect |
| Free tier | 3 scans/day | Unknown | Free (in Yelp app) | 3 AI Top 3/day + unlimited scans (different gate) |
| Paywall trigger | After 3 scans | Unknown | None | After 3 AI calls/day — paywall hits after value proven |

**Takeaway:** MenuGuide and FoodieLens translate menus. Yelp Menu Vision overlays photos on a live camera view. None of them recommend. None use trust badges. None gate the paywall on the AI recommendation rather than the scan itself. NOM's model — unlimited free scans, paywall only on the AI "wow moment" — is structurally different and more likely to convert users who have already seen value.
